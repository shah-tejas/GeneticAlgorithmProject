## Problem Statement:

### Event Table Organizer (Using Genetic Algorithm)

In any social event, the guests at the event are seated in a finite number of tables. 
It is essential to have guests with similar interests accomodated in the same table.
There are various factors that would influence the assignment of guests to tables like personal interests, food preferences or if they are related. 
The seating of each guest would affect his/her experience at the event. Thus, it would be essential to have guests with similar interests seated together to make the event a success.

Using **Genetic Algorithm** to solve this problem would be a good strategy as we could get various optimal solutions in finite time.

The solution for the algorithm would be arrangement of n number of guests at m number of tables, such that like minded or related persons are seated at each table.
